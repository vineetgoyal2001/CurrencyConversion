# Currency conversion

# 5 test cases are automated. I have used JUnit to run all theses test cases. Path is CurrencyConversion\src\test\java\com\currencycoversion\VerifyCurrencyConversion

#Created all classes for all currency conversion(EUR to USD,EUR to GBP,EUR to CAD,EUR to NZD,EUR to INR)

# I have taken the API (EUR to USD) https://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.jsonapp_id=YOUR_APP_ID&base=EUR&symbols=USD  but it is not working. I have written the logic for current rate conversion. Please provide me the live API current rate conversion

# I have used JUnit assertion for verification

# Reporting Allure need to configure
